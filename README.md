*Pokemon*

I built the project on top of the Pokemon API. Using React.js and Tailwind for styling and Axios to interact with the API.You give me the freedom to do whatever I want. So I build a pagination system that display all the pokemons and you can naviage between deffrent pages

**To run the project** 
1. clone the project then 
2. Run `npm i`
3. Then `npm start`
